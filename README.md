# mapupAI-Assingment Intersections API
The Intersections API is a mapping-based service that determines the intersections between a given linestring and a set of randomly spread lines on a plane. It is built using Node.js and the Express framework, with integration of the turf.js library for spatial calculations.

#API Features
>Accepts a POST request protected with a header-based authentication check.
>Expects a GeoJSON linestring with 5,000 points in the request body.
>Contains a set of 50 randomly spread lines, each represented by a start and end point.
>Determines which of the 50 lines intersect with the provided linestring.
>Returns an array of intersecting line IDs along with the point of intersection.

#API Endpoints
POST /intersections
This endpoint handles the intersection calculation between the linestring and the set of lines.
Requires an Authorization header with a valid authentication token.
Expects a valid GeoJSON linestring in the request body.
Returns an array of intersecting line IDs and their corresponding intersection points, or an empty array if no intersections are found.
Returns appropriate error messages and status codes for invalid requests.

#Getting Started
>Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
>Install the required dependencies using npm install.
>Start the API server by running node app.js.
>The server will start listening on port 3000.
>Testing the API with Postman
>Ensure that the server is running.
>Open Postman and create a new request.
>Set the request method to POST and the URL to http://localhost:3000/intersections.

>Add an Authorization header with the format Bearer <authentication_token>, where <authentication_token> is the valid token generated by the server.
>Set the request body to a GeoJSON linestring with 5,000 points.
>Click the Send button to send the request and receive the intersections data.
>Please note that the provided linestring should be a valid GeoJSON object in the request body.

#Dependencies
>Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
>body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON bodies in the requests.
>turf.js: A library for spatial calculations and geo-processing.
>uuid: A package for generating unique identifiers (used for authentication token generation).
